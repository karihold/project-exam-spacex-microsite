                        A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction, aerospace engineering, and
                        scientific proposals since the 19th century. SpaceX’s goal is to send our first cargo mission to
                        Mars in 2022. The objectives for the first mission will be to confirm water resources, identify
                        hazards, and put in place initial power, mining, and life support infrastructure.
                        The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Preliminary work
                        for missions that would involve human explorers has been undertaken since the 1950s, with
                        planned missions typically being stated as taking place 10 to 30 years in the future when they
                        are drafted. A second mission, with both cargo and crew, is targeted for 2024, with primary
                        objectives of building a propellant depot and preparing for future crew flights. The ships from
                        these initial missions will also serve as the beginnings of the first Mars base, from which we
                        can build a thriving city and eventually a self-sustaining civilization on Mars.
