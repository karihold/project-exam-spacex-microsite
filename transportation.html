                        SpaceX. The second stage and ship was renamed by CEO Elon Musk to Starship. The first stage was
                        given
                        the moniker "Super Heavy". The payload capacity to Earth orbit is cited as being at least
                        100,000 kg
                        (220,000 lb), making BFR a super heavy-lift launch vehicle. The first orbital flight will occur
                        no
                        earlier than 2020, with a flight around the Moon slated for 2023. The overall space vehicle
                        architecture includes both launch vehicle and spacecraft, as well as ground infrastructure for
                        rapid
